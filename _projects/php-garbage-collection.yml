  PHP accidentally became a programming language, and decisions in the language
  semantics have restricted common implementations to reference counting garbage collection.
  This project aims to achieve high performance garbage collection for Facebook's
  HipHop Virtual Machine.

  For my honours project and thesis in 2015, I'm working on HHVM to introduce high performance
  garbage collection in the form of a tracing garbage collector, using a mark-region based
  memory manager. Several obstacles stand in the way: PHP as a language is married to reference
  counting, relying on exact reference counts for copy-on-write optimisations, and relying on
  the destruction of objects happening at an exact moment when the reference count drops to zero,
  which no longer is assured when using tracing garbage collection.
